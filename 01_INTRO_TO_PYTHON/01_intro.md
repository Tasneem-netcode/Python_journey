 # ✅ Verify if Python is Installed

To **confirm that Python was installed correctly**, follow these steps:



### Step 1: Open your terminal or command prompt
- On **Windows**, make sure you have added Python’s path to your **Environment Variables** before using it in the Command Prompt.  
- On **macOS/Linux**, just open your terminal.



### Step 2: Run the command to check Python version

```bash
python --version


If Python 3 is installed and set as default, you’ll see something like:
👉 Python 3.x (where x is any version ≥ 3.0)
Example output:

nginx
Copy
Edit
Python 3.6.0
